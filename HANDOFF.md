- **Changed:** All three session readers (WtFF, Ashfall, SITL): moved "Open threads"/"Quests & objectives" card into the center column directly below "Narrative summary"; made "Full roll log" section collapsible, default collapsed, with clickable header toggle and ▸/▾ caret. WtFF only: added "Scene / timeline" and "Themes & beats" cards in center column (wired to `renderScene`/`renderThemes`, hidden if section absent). Ashfall's collapsible log + quests position were already correct from a prior edit — only the column re-order was applied. pacts-and-power untouched.
- **Commit:** `session readers: move quests to center, collapsible roll log (SITL/WtFF/Ashfall); add Scene+Themes to WtFF`
- **Next:** Add Scene / Timeline Breakdown and Themes & Emotional Beats sections to WtFF vault notes for them to render.

- **Changed:** Wired WtFF Session 02 "Something's Changing" (2026-06-28) into the session reader (`ARC` array in `session.html`) and the archive map (`CONFIG.events[0].sessions` in `archive.html`, Rhusatatiam node). Prev/next nav, tags (⚑ Crossover, ● Roleplay), and popover link all wired. Session 00 intentionally excluded.
- **Commit:** `WtFF: wire Session 02 (Something's Changing) into session reader + map`
- **Next:** Add Session 03 the same way when notes are ready.

- **Changed:** `app.js` — replaced the single hardcoded `QuoteBoard` with a live, per-campaign random-quote loader. Added a `vault` field to each campaign in `D`; fetches `00-Campaign-Hub/Quote Board Master.md`, follows the `[[Quote Board …]]` batch-file links (SITL & Ashfall masters are stubs), parses three formats (bold-header, blockquote, P&P table), dedupes, and random-picks on mount + on campaign switch.
- **Commit:** `feat: live per-campaign random quotes on dashboard` (fill short-SHA on push)
- **Next:** eyeball all 4 campaigns, then build the live roll-stats pipeline (Phase 1).
- **Watch out:** parser validated against live vault data (SITL 299 / P&P 206 / Ashfall 112 / WTFF 19 quotes) but full browser render was not testable in-sandbox. `app.js` is ~50KB → local-Git deploy.

- **Changed:** `where-the-flowers-forget/archive.html` — reworked the campaign→map intro. The tarot card now flies to center **and** turns horizontal in one motion (cross-page view transition), flips to reveal the map (lands upright, un-mirrored), then enlarges and un-crops into the live map. Added `@view-transition` opt-in + `hero-card` resting state rotated 90°.
- **Commit:** `feat: rotating fly-in flip-to-map intro on WTFF archive` (fill short-SHA on push)
- **Next:** superseded by the live-quotes task above.
- **Watch out:** the combined fly+turn needs a Chromium browser; it degrades gracefully (no fly/turn, still flip→grow) elsewhere.
